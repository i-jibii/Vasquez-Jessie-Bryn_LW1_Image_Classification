**1.  What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?**
- The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, each sized 28 by 28 pixels. It contains 10 classes, including shirts, shoes, bags, and dresses. The dataset is widely used to practice image classification and evaluate machine learning models on visual data.

**2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?**
- We normalize image pixel values before training to scale them from 0–255 to 0–1. This helps the model learn faster, improves numerical stability, and reduces errors caused by large input values. Normalization ensures the neural network can process the data efficiently.
